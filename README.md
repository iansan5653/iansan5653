### :rocket: Hello!

I'm a full-stack developer & mechanical engineer who loves TypeScript & Scala (and I'll tolerate Python every so often).

I work as a consultant in the financial sector at [Galatea Associates](http://www.galatea-associates.com/).

The best way to get in contact with me is to open an issue on one of my repositories. If it's not relevant to a specific project, feel free to [start a new discussion](https://github.com/iansan5653/iansan5653/discussions/new) on my profile repo. Feel free to ask me anything.
