**👋 Hello!**

I'm a software engineer working on the Planning & Tracking team right here at GitHub :octocat:, building the [new GitHub Issues](https://github.com/features/issues).

I mostly focus on front-end web development (in vanilla JS, TypeScript, React, and Angular) but I've also done server-side work (in Java and Scala), [Windows applications](https://github.com/iansan5653/open-mcr), desktop software plugins, and even embedded systems.

I graduated from the University of South Florida in 2020 with a degree in mechanical engineering, where I spent most of my time [building rockets](https://instagram.com/usfsoar) 🚀.

⛵ In my free time I sail/work on my old sailboat here in St. Petersburg, FL ☀️. Occasionally I [take pictures 📷](https://instagram.com/iansan5653) and [make cocktails 🍸](https://instagram.com/fiddle.leaf.cocktails).
