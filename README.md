**ðŸ‘‹ Hello!**

I'm a software engineer building GitHub here on GitHub :octocat:.

I mostly focus on front-end web development (in vanilla JS, TypeScript, React, and Angular) but I've also done server-side work (in Java and Scala), [Windows applications](https://github.com/iansan5653/open-mcr), desktop software plugins, and even embedded systems. My [resume](https://iansan5653.github.io/resume/) is public and mostly updated.

I graduated from USF in 2020 with a degree in mechanical engineering, where I spent way too much of my time [building rockets](https://instagram.com/usfsoar) ðŸš€.

In my free time I work on and race sailboats in Tampa Bay â›µ.
