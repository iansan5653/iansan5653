**:rocket: Hello!**

I'm a full-stack developer & mechanical engineer specializing in TypeScript & Scala (and I begrudgingly work with Python occasionally üêç).

Currently I work on the Planning and Tracking team here at GitHub, building the [new GitHub Projects](https://github.com/features/issues).
