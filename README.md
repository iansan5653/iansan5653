**ðŸ‘‹ Hello!**

I'm a software engineer working on the Planning & Tracking team right here at GitHub :octocat:, building the [new GitHub Issues](https://github.com/features/issues).

I mostly focus on front-end web development (in vanilla JS, TypeScript, React, and Angular) but I've also done server-side work (in Java and Scala), [Windows applications](https://github.com/iansan5653/open-mcr), desktop software plugins, and even embedded systems.

I graduated from USF in 2020 with a degree in mechanical engineering, where I spent way too much time [building rockets](https://instagram.com/usfsoar) ðŸš€.

In my free time I race sailboats in Tampa Bay â›µ.
